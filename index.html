  <h1>All about Me</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Hello, My name is Sabina Bhattarai, I was born on November 21, 2003, at 10:53 p.m, and this is my website. This website's main focus is going to be me, my friends, and family, and some more of me. I'm making this website as a result of my Web Design class at LHHS. If you look to the top left there is a little guide that will help you nagivate my website. We are on the first page, the second page will include an introduction to some of my family. The third page will include background on me and lastly the fourth, and final, page will have my contact information if you have any questions or comments. </p>
